## Difference between MaterialBalancer and StorioGrapher

## Isn't this one of the comparison charts?

Yes, it is. But have better and nice features for practical comparison.

At first, MaterialBalancer has View mode for comparing with many aspect.
Many of comparison charts have only one view or sorting function for a column.
Also, it may not provide column re-ordering even it provides column selecting.
Even if it could provide more configurable options, it may not provide column mirroring.

## Can I do the same thing with a spreadsheet?

Yes, you may can, but not every feature.
At least, you may not able to do grouping.

## Is this Open Source?

It would be. But not sure because we couldn't agree with that which OSS license is suited for our purpose.
I published this code as readable for everyone, but I couldn't guarantee that you can reuse this freely.
