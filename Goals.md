## Just a table

Could add an item to an axis.
This is a fundamental feature.

## Customized view for each item

You can make a customizable(re-allocatable) view for each item.
Moreover, you can place a spacer or a label between values.

For example,
* About item A, you may want to show values of `{ W, X, Y, Z }` as the order of `{ W, X || Z, Y }`
* About item B, you may want to show values of `{ W, X, Y, Z }` as the order of `{ W || X, Y, Z }`

## Ambiguous item/value

You can allocate value for an item more than one place like `{ W, X, Z || W, Y, Z }`
